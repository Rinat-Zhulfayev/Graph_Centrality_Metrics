# Graph_Centrality_Metrics
Betweenness and Closeness centrality metrics and rank the nodes of the given two graph datasets which are Zachary Karate Club Network and Facebook Social Network.
Explanation of Centrality Metrics
Centrality metrics are used to identify the most important nodes within a graph. There are various centrality metrics including Degree, 
Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector, Katz, PageRank, etc. In the scope of this project, you are expected to implement the following two 
centrality metrics and test on the given two graph datasets.

1.	Betweenness Centrality
Betweenness centrality shows the strategic location of a node in a graph. Betweenness centrality of a node n is defined as the number of shortest paths going through
the node n. For each pair of nodes, shortest paths between them are computed and the fraction of shortest paths passing through n is calculated. 
2.	Closeness Centrality
Closeness centrality depends on measure of how close a node is to the other nodes in the graph. A node in a more central location is considered
closer to all other nodes.
